Scientists found out it's a piece of a ship that seems to be made for colonizing planets. The subjects inside aren't fully developed. It seems that this process has been interrupted when the ship split up. The wreck has been given to several research facilities now but noone was able to emulate the form of energy which it needs in order to function. The LMC bought it and now uses it for their Tournaments.",FallbackName="Incuvasion")
