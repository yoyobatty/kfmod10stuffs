During their retreat of the area, a few NEG squadrons decided to take back what was once there own from the rebels. Using their extensive knowledge of the area and the fact they knew the area better than the rebels occupying it, NEG forces acted quickly to try and stop the rebels communication to other factions.  Since NEG forces weren't large enough to take back the communications array and hold it for reinforcements, the plan involved the complete destruction of the array.",FallbackName="Vindication")
