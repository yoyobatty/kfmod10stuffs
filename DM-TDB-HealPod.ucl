Construction of this facility started in 2285 and was completed in the year 2291. Its purpose has remained the same to this day -- to provide the competitors with the ability to self-administer aid as quickly as possible to their injuries during the short time allotted between matches. There have been many regulations instated by the Tournament Commission to prohibit the discharging of weapons within the facility but Tournament competitors rarely follow this rule.|||Map Credits|-------------||Remake UT2004 Mapper / DM-TDB-HealPod:|Teddie 'teddabod' Tapawan||Original UT1 Mappers / DM-HealPod][:|Cliff Bleszinski / Alan Willard||Music Credits|---------------||HealPod]['s original UT1 music 'SuperFist' re-performed by Teddie Tapawan (a.k.a.
