Panalesh contained a race that is believed to have become extinct only recently and most think this is the work of the infamous Skaarj. This was confirmed when huge quantities of Tarydium deposits were discovered which gives a definite objective for the Skaarj, and Liandri even bought the whole planet. Whilst performing extensive mining on most of the planet and fighting off Skaarj and Izanagi strike forces, this Tarydium induced lake was saved just for the tournament Onslaught matches due to its size. The Lake Mynolor site or Watcher of the Sky, settled amongst the Kreenook spire mountain range was perfect for a large Onslaught map. And seriously tests the combatants team management and cooperation.||www.third-helix.com||bradley.jones@kilkenny.ath.cx",FallbackName=":[  Panalesh  ]: ")
