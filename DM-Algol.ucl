Both stars are relatively cool, therefore the planet's close orbit and atmospheric conditions are able to support life.  Night only falls for a few short months twice a year, where the orbit reaches its furthest point from both stars. ||It never rains here as such; water seeps out of the ground when heated, and forms a thick layer of surface fog and groundwater, which is then re-absorbed once it cools.  The native plant life uses frond-like leaves or hollow structures to capture moisture from the air. ||Enough science lessons, time to fight!",FallbackName="Algol")
