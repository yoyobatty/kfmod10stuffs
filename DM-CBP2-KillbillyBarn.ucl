There wasn't much left fer anyone to do 'round here. Miss havin' ya 'round.||As ya know, the farm's on its last walkin' legs. It hasn't shed a drop 'round these parts in months. My cornfield's all dried up, burnt to a crisp. The only bit of water left is in the lil' waterin' hole out back and even that's dryin' up. The corn silo's half empty...||I'll need to sell the farm if some miracle doesn't happen right soon.||MaryLou, I know you don't condone drinkin', but the only thing that's keeping me sane is my 'shine still tucked out in the shed up on the hill. And even then, I ain't sure 'cause...||... I swear, damn scarecrow out in the field keeps laffin' at me and some flyin' saucer thing blew up my last cow with a purple laser-beam.||I gotta go.
